# React useEffect Hook Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React applications involving the `useEffect` hook.  The bug involves incorrect conditional rendering logic within the `useEffect`'s callback and a missing dependency in the dependency array.

## Bug Description
The provided `MyComponent` uses `useEffect` to log a message when the `count` state variable is greater than 0. The original code had two issues:

1. **Incorrect Conditional Rendering:** The conditional logic (`if (count > 0)`) within `useEffect` is not correctly handling the initial render where `count` is 0. This can lead to unexpected behavior. 
2. **Missing Dependency:** The `count` variable is used inside the `useEffect` callback, but it's not included in the dependency array `[count]`. This can result in stale closures and unexpected behavior or infinite renders.

## Solution
The solution addresses both issues by improving the conditional rendering logic and correctly including the `count` variable in the `useEffect` dependency array.
